# ChecklistCreator

This is my pet project I'm working on in spare time.

The idea of creating this app came to me when I saw that people used papers sticked to the fridge to track their progress of challenges like stopping smoking, eating sugar or starting training every day. I decided to create a simple iOS application to get rid of papers and keep track on challenges progress everywhere with help of iOS-device on my pocket.

It's far away from being perfectly workable. I am improving it to become much better.
